When I was three years old, my father would take me to the computer, which ran
Windows 95. He would open Word and set a big dingbat font, that had
animals instead of regular letters. I pressed the keys, and some dinosaurs,
elephants and zebras appeared on the screen. I was *amazed*, every time!

I liked to play with all the stuff I could find---faxes, an old amplifier,
PCs, TVs. My grandfather was an electrician, and I learned to connect RCDs
to light bulbs and plugs. Those times when I accidentally felt the 230 Volts
through my body didn't stop me from trying again, no matter what my father said.

With eight years, my uncle asked "Do you want to learn Java?". I had no
idea what 'java' could mean. My uncles don't usually make me presents; instead
they sit with me and we have some great time together. So I agreed.

When I discovered that 'java' allowed me to take control of the computer,
I couldn't stop. It was *fascinating*. For the first time ever, I could tell
the computer what to do. I'd no longer be a mere consumer, *the computer
would work for me*.

What's more, I learned the Internet had lots of great information and
tutorials, and I quickly saw Java wasn't the only option, so I started exploring
other languages. But I had a dream: I wanted to find a way the computer could
interact with all the electrical circuits I made... That'd have to wait.

My emotional life hasn't been easy, but I feel really happy now. I want to
learn about everything, and I can't wait for university. I started teaching
JavaScript to my brother (eight or nine years old) and he likes it a lot!

So in the end, I want to thank all my family ([dog](/media/2014-05-15-how-it-all-started/cadi.jpg)
included) for all their help. And a bunch of other people, which I consider to
be part of the family. You made me possible. Thank you so much.
