I honestly don't know what to write here.

I'll start by saying I'm a passionate person. I enjoy learning things, and I always try to do something useful with what I learn. They say it's the hacker mindset...

Programming allows one to build awesome things with just a computer and some spare time, without having to pay for appropiate tools and material. So it's understandable that I've devoted (way too much) time to programming and computers in general since [I started](http://jmendeth.com/blog/how-it-all-started) with Java when I was a kid.

A very idealist person I am. I strongly believe in open-source and openness in general. I am a [pirate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Party), and you should be, too. Just sayin'.
